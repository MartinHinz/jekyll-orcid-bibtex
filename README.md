# jekyll-orcid-bibtex

Jekyll plugin that writes a bibtex bibliography file based on the publications in a user's Open Researcher & Contributor ID ([ORCID](http://orcid.org)) profile. Heavily inspired by [mfenner/jekyll-orcid](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-orcid).

Installation
------------

#### Put file `jekyll-orcid-bibtex.rb` into your Jekyll `_plugins` folder
#### Install the json gem:
Either manually.

    gem install json

or put

    gem 'json'

into your Gemfile

#### Add your ORCID identifier to `_config.yml`:

    author:
      orcid: 0000-0002-1825-0097

#### (Optionally) change the folder where the bibliographies are stored in `_config.yml`. The default is:

    scholar:
      source:          ./bibliography

Use
---

The bibtex file generated by jekyll-orcid-bibtex can be used to generate reference lists that works really well with [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).
